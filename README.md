Requirements:
The goals of this project are to use displacement mapping to turn a simple shape into a more interesting one, re-compute its normals, bump-map it, and light it.

The turnin for this project will be all of the source files and a PDF report containing:

What you did and explaining why it worked this way
Side-by-side images showing different values for the input parameters
Per-fragment lighted image(s) showing that your normal computation is correct.
Per-fragment lighted image(s) showing that your bump-mapping is correct.
A link to your video
This needs to be a PDF file turned into Teach with your other source files. You can use zip to lump your source files together, but be sure to keep your PDF outside your .zip file so I can gather up all the PDF files at once with a script.

The Scenario:
You have a curtain with pleats. The pleats are a sine wave that moves in the X direction. The top of the curtain is fixed on a rod, so the pleating is zero there, and increases as you go down in -Y.
